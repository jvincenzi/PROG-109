setTimeout(function(){alert("Hi World")},1000);

 


The setTimeout will take two arguments: The code it is to run and the delay.

In the above example the alert("Hi World") will trigger after 1 second. The time of 1000 is in milliseconds and is equal to 1 second.

Example of loading a setTimeout into a variable:

var myTimeout=setTimeout(init, 2000);

In the above example it will trigger a function named init() after two seconds.

A setTimeout  is usually cleared by placing the clear method inside of another function and then triggering the clear by a user event or based on a condition in your program:

function stopFunction()
{
    clearTimeout(myTimeout);
}
